<div class="center"><big>PREFACE</big></div>

<p><i>Henri Dunant, the famous author of "A
Souvenir of Solferino," was born in Geneva
in 1828.</i></p>

<p><i>The instruction and philanthropic principles
received by him in his youth, together
with his natural energy and power of organization,
were a good foundation for the unfolding
of the ideas and inclinations which
led to his fertile acts.</i></p>

<p><i>In 1859 occurred the event which definitely
impelled him to a course of action
which did not discontinue during his whole
life. A course of action for the mitigation
of the sufferings caused by war, or from a
broader point of view, for the commencement
of the reign of peace.</i></p>

<p><i>This event was the battle of Solferino,
when he first organized, in Castiglione, corps
of volunteers to search for and nurse the
wounded.</i></p>

<p><i>Having thus started the idea of a permanent
organization of these voluntary
bands of compassionate workers, and also
of an international treaty agreement in regard
to the wounded, he presented himself</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
<i>to Marshal MacMahon and afterwards to
Napoleon III, who became interested in the
project of Dunant and immediately ordered
his army no longer to make prisoners of the
physicians and nurses of the enemy.</i></p>

<p><i>Soon Dunant organized an Aid Committee
in Geneva, and shortly afterwards he
published his "Souvenir of Solferino," which
was enthusiastically received and greatly
applauded.</i></p>

<p><i>He met, however, opposition and obstacles,
principally from the French Minister of
War.</i></p>

<p><i>The philanthropic ideas of this book were
received with interest by many European
sovereigns with whom Dunant had intercourse,
either by correspondence or by conversation;
he always propagated persistently
his ideas in regard to the organization of a
national permanent committee for the
wounded, his International Treaty, and the
neutralization of those injured in war (he
developed in separate works his ideas which
were outlined only in the "Souvenir").</i></p>

<p><i>The Geneva Society of Public Utility
created a commission for the purpose of
studying the question. Meanwhile Dunant
had the opportunity to speak with the King
of Saxony, and to persuade representatives</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vii" id="Page_vii">[vii]</a></span>
<i>of some other countries to take up the question
with their respective sovereigns.</i></p>

<p><i>Dunant interested the governments so
much in his project that various nations sent
delegates to the International Conference,
which was held in Geneva, in 1863, when it
was decided to establish a National Committee,
and when the desire was expressed
that the neutralization of the physicians,
nurses and injured should be provided by
treaty, and for the adoption of a distinctive
and uniform international emblem and flag
for the hospital corps, and the unanimous
thanks of this Conference were extended to
Dunant.</i></p>

<p><i>To consider this subject, a diplomatic International
Congress was held in 1864, at
Geneva, by invitation of the Swiss Federate
Counsel. The treaty there drafted accepted
the projects of Dunant and the formation
of Volunteer Aid Societies, later called Red
Cross Societies, was recommended by the
Convention to the signatory powers.</i></p>

<p><i>In the further development of the ideas
of Dunant The Hague Conference, in 1899,
extended the provisions of the Treaty of
Geneva to naval warfare.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus, a single individual, inspired with the
sentiment of kindness and compassion for</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
<i>his fellow-creatures, by his own untiring
energy attained the realization of his ideas,
and aided in the progress of mankind toward
peace.</i></p>

<p><i>Thus, truly all men, and above all, the
workers for peace, owe to this laborer
merited and everlasting gratitude and remembrance.</i></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p><i>The recompense, however, arrived late.</i></p>

<p><i>In the zealous propaganda, for which, during
four years, he edited pamphlets and
articles in all languages, and traveled continuously
through the whole of Europe,
Dunant spent everything that he possessed,
and, for many years, nothing more was
heard of the modest and good man, to whom
the approval of his conscience was all sufficient.</i></p>

<p><i>At last, in 1897, he was discovered in the
Swiss village of Heiden, where he was living
in misery, in a "Home" for old men, with
almost no means other than a small pension
received from the Empress of Russia.</i></p>

<p><i>The Baroness von Suttner sent at that
time to the press of the whole world, and
especially to those interested in International
Peace, an appeal to raise a contribution of
money to ease his last years. In 1901, when</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
<i>the Nobel-Peace-Prize, valued at 208,000
francs, was awarded for the first time, it
was divided between Henri Dunant and
Frederick Passy.</i></p>

<p><i>It is true that many peace workers did
not approve of this decision of the Nobel
Committee. They said in opposition, that
the projects of Dunant not only were not
pacific, but could even have the contrary
effect. To lessen the terrors of war is really,
according to them, to destroy the most effective
means of turning men from it, and
consequently tended to prolong the duration
of its reign. One of the chief representatives
of this idea, Signor H. H. Fried, said that
the Geneva Convention was only a small
concession by the governments to the new
idea that is fighting against war.</i></p>

<p><i>Without doubt, they do not approve of the
humane plan of Dunant, on the contrary,
they think that it is not essentially peace-making;
that it should not be recompensed
by the first peace prize, and that it is dangerous
to confuse pacification with simple humanitarianism.</i></p>

<p><i>The contrary opinion is shown by the following
words, written by Signor Ruyssin,
in the review "Peace by Right," at the time
when Dunant received his prize:</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span></p>

<p><i>"His glory has grown each year in proportion
to all the lessening of suffering which
his work has accomplished, to all the lives
which it saves, and to all the self-devotion
to which it gives birth.</i></p>

<p><i>"Henri Dunant has decreased the abomination
of war; Frederick Passy fought to
make it impossible. One has accomplished
more; the other has created more remote,
but brighter hopes. One has harvested already;
the other sows for the future harvest;
and so it would be arbitrary and unjust to
compare such dissimilar lines of work, both
equally meritorious. The accomplishment of
the wishes of Nobel rightly placed identical
crowns on the heads of two old men who
employed their lives in fighting against
war."</i></p>

<p><i>This disagreement is interesting in that
it shows the contrary judgment to which different
zealous peace workers were led in regard
to the project of Dunant.</i></p>

<p><i>Whatever may be the conclusion of the
reader, about the relation between it and the
peace propaganda, he will certainly be of
the opinion that "A Souvenir of Solferino,"
showing the abominations of war, is a useful
instrument of the propaganda, and that
the name of Dunant should be blessed, as</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
<i>that of one of the most self-devoted benefactors
of mankind.</i></p>

<p><i>Henri Dunant died at Heiden, Switzerland,
on October the thirty-first, 1910.</i>

<div class="center"><big>THE ORIGIN OF THE RED CROSS</big><br /></div>

<p>The bloody victory of Magenta opened the
gates of Milan to the French Army, which
the towns of Pavia, Lodi and Cremona welcomed
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>The Austrians, abandoning the lines of the
Adda, the Oglio, and the Chiese, gathered
their forces on the bank of the River Mincio,
at whose head the young and courageous
Emperor Joseph placed himself.</p>

<p>The King of Sardinia, Victor Emmanuel,
arrived on the seventeenth of June, 1859,
at Brescia, where, with great joy, the inhabitants
welcomed him, seeing in the son of
Charles Albert a saviour and a hero. During
the next day the French Emperor entered
the same town amid the enthusiastic
cries of the people, happy to show their
gratitude to the monarch who came to help
them gain their independence.</p>

<p>On the twenty-first of June, Napoleon III
and Victor Emmanuel II left Brescia, from
which place their armies had departed during
the previous day. On the twenty-second
they occupied Lonato, Castenedolo and Montechiaro.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
On the evening of the twenty-third
Napoleon, who was commander-in-chief,
published strict orders for the army
of the King of Sardinia, encamped at Desenzano,
and forming the left flank of the allied
armies, to proceed early the following day
to Pozzelengo.</p>

<p>Marshal Baraguey d'Hilliers was ordered
to march on Solferino; Marshal MacMahon,
Duke de Magenta, on Cavriana; General Neil
was to proceed to Guidizzolo; Marshal Canrobert
to Medole; Marshal Regnaud de Saint-Jean
d'Angley, with the Imperial Guard, to
Castiglione.</p>

<p>These united forces amounted to 150,000
men, with 400 cannon.</p>

<p>The Austrian Emperor had at his disposition,
in the Lombardo-Venetian kingdom,
nine army corps, amounting in all to 250,000
men, comprising the garrison of Verona and
Mantua. The effective force prepared to
enter the line of battle consisted of seven
corps, some 170,000 men, supported by 500
cannon.</p>

<p>The headquarters of the Emperor Francis
Joseph had been moved from Verona to Villafranca,
then to Valeggio. On the evening
of the twenty-third the Austrian troops received
the order to recross the River Mincio<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
during the night to Peschiera, Salionze,
Valeggio, Ferri, Goito and Mantua. The
main part of the army took up its position
from Pozzolengo to Guidizzolo, in order to
attack the enemy between the Rivers Mincio
and Chiese.</p>

<p>The Austrian forces formed two armies.
The first having as Commander-in-chief
Count Wimpffen, under whose orders were
the corps commanded by Field Marshals
Prince Edmund Schwarzenberg, Count
Schaffgotsche and Baron Veigl, also the
cavalry division of Count Zeidewitz. This
composed the left flank. It was stationed in
the neighborhood of Volta, Guidizzolo, Medole
and Castel-Gioffredo.</p>

<p>The second army was commanded by
Count Schlick, having under his orders the
Field Marshals Count Clam-Gallas, Count
Stadion, Baron Zobel and Cavalier Benedek,
as well as the cavalry division of Count
Mensdorf. This composed the right flank.
It occupied Cavriana, Pozzolengo and San
Martino.</p>

<p>Thus, on the morning of the twenty-fourth,
the Austrians occupied all the heights between
Pozzolengo, Solferino, Cavriana and
Guidizzolo. They ranged their artillery in
series of breastworks, forming the center of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
the attacking line, which permitted their
right and left flanks to fall back upon these
fortified heights which they believed to be
unconquerable.</p>

<p>The two belligerent armies, although
marching one against the other, did not expect
such a sudden meeting. Austria, misinformed,
supposed that only a part of the
allied army had crossed the Chiese River.
On their side the confederates did not expect
this attack in return, and did not believe
that they would find themselves so soon before
the army of the Austrian Emperor.
The reconnoitering, the observations and the
reports of the scouts, and those made from
the fire balloons during the day of the
twenty-third showed no signs of such an imminent
encounter.</p>

<p>The collision of the armies of Austria and
Franco-Sardinia on Friday, the twenty-fourth
of June, 1859, was, therefore, unexpected,
although the combatants on both
sides conjectured that a great battle was
near.</p>

<p>The Austrian army, already fatigued by
the difficult march during the night of the
twenty-third and twenty-fourth, had to support
from the earliest dawn the attack of
the enemies' armies and to suffer from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
intensely hot weather as well as from hunger
and thirst, for, except a double ration of
brandy, the greater number of the Austrians
were unable to take any food.</p>

<p>The French troops already in movement
before daybreak had had nothing but coffee.
Therefore, this exhaustion of the soldiers,
and above all, of the unfortunate wounded,
was extreme at the end of this very bloody
battle, which lasted more than fifteen hours.</p>

<p>Both armies are awake.</p>

<p>Three hundred thousand men are standing
face to face. The line of battle is ten miles
long.</p>

<p>Already at three o'clock in the morning,
corps commanded by Marshals Baraguey d'Hilliers and MacMahon are commencing to
move on Solferino and Cavriana.</p>

<p>Hardly have the advance columns passed
Castiglione when they themselves are in the
presence of the first posts of the Austrians,
who dispute the ground.</p>

<p>On all sides bugles are playing the charges
and the drums are sounding.</p>

<p>The Emperor Napoleon who passed the
night at Montechiaro hastens rapidly to Castiglione.</p>

<p>By six o'clock a furious fire has commenced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>The Austrians march in a compact mass in
perfect order along the open roads. In the
air are flying their black and yellow standards,
on which are embroidered the ancient
Imperial arms.</p>

<p>The day is very clear. The Italian sun
makes the brilliant equipments of the dragoons,
the lancers and the cuirassiers of the
French army glitter brightly.</p>

<p>At the commencement of the engagement
the Emperor Francis Joseph, together with
his entire staff, leaves headquarters in order
to go to Volta. He is accompanied by the
Archdukes of the House of Lorraine, among
whom are the Grand Duke of Tuscany and
the Duke of Modena.</p>

<p>In the midst of the difficulties of a field
unknown to the French army the first meeting
takes place. It has to make its way
through plantations of mulberry trees, interlaced
by climbing vines, which form almost
impassable barriers.</p>

<p>The earth is cut by great dried up trenches
which the horses have to leap, and by long
walls with broad foundations which they
have to climb.</p>

<p>From the hills the Austrians pour on the
enemy a constant hail of shot and shell. With
the smoke of the cannon's continual discharge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
the rain of bullets is ploughing up
the earth and dust into thousands of missiles.</p>

<p>The French hurl themselves upon these
strongly fortified places in spite of the firing
of the batteries which falls upon the earth
with redoubled force.</p>

<p>During the burning heat of noon the battle
everywhere becomes more and more furious.</p>

<p>Column after column throw themselves
one against the other with the force of a
devastating torrent.</p>

<p>A number of French regiments surround
masses of Austrian troops, but, like iron
walls, these resist and at first remain unshaken.</p>

<p>Entire divisions throw their knapsacks to
the earth in order to rush at the enemy with
fixed bayonets.</p>

<p>If a battalion is driven away another replaces
it; each hill, each height, each rocky
eminence becomes a theatre for an obstinate
struggle.</p>

<p>On the heights, as well as in the ravines,
the dead lie piled up. The Austrians and the
allied armies march one against the other,
killing each other above the blood-covered
corpses, butchering with gunshots, crushing
each other's skulls or disemboweling with
the sword or bayonet. No cessation in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
conflict, no quarter given. The wounded are
defending themselves to the last. It is
butchery by madmen drunk with blood.</p>

<p>Sometimes the fighting becomes more terrible
on account of the arrival of rushing,
galloping cavalry. The horses, more compassionate
than their riders, seek in vain
to step over the victims of this butchery, but
their iron hoofs crush the dead and dying.
With the neighing of the horses are mingled
blasphemies, cries of rage, shrieks of pain
and despair.</p>

<p>The artillery, at full speed, follows the
cavalry which has cut a way through the
corpses and the wounded lying in confusion
on the ground. A jaw-bone of one of these
last is torn away; the head of another is
battered in; the breast of a third is crushed.
Limbs are broken and bruised; the field is
covered with human remains; the earth is
soaked with blood.</p>

<p>The French troops, with fiery ardor, scale
the steep hills and rocky declivities in spite
of shot and shell.</p>

<p>Hardly does some harassed and profusely
perspiring company capture a hill and reach
its summit, when it falls like an avalanche
on the Austrians, overthrows, repulses and
pursues them to the depths of the hollows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>But the Austrians regain the advantage.
Ambuscaded behind the houses, the churches
and the walls of Medole, Solferino and Cavriana,
they heroically fight on and very nearly
win the victory.</p>

<p>The unending combat rages incessantly
and in every place with fury. Nothing stops,
nothing interrupts the butchery. They are
killing one another by the hundreds. Every
foot of ground is carried at the bayonet's
point, every post disputed foot by foot.
From the hands of the enemy are taken
villages, house after house, farm after farm,
each is the theatre of a siege. Doors, windows
and courts are abattoirs.</p>

<p>A rain of cannon balls is sending death
to the distant reserves of Austria. If these
desert the field they yield it only step by
step, and soon recommence action. Their
ranks are ceaselessly reforming. On the
plains the wind raises the dust, which flies
over the roads like dense clouds, darkening
the day and blinding the fighters.</p>

<p>The French cavalry flings itself on the
Austrian cavalry; uhlans and hussars slash
furiously at each other with their swords.</p>

<p>The rage is so great that in some places,
after the exhaustion of the cartridges and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the breaking of the muskets, they fight with
fists and beat one another with stones.</p>

<p>The strongest positions are captured, lost,
and recaptured, to be lost again. Everywhere
men are falling mutilated, riddled
with bullets, covered with wounds.</p>

<p>In the midst of these endless combats,
these massacres, blasphemies arise in different
tongues, telling of the diverse nationalities
of the men, many of whom are obliged
to become homicides in their twentieth year.</p>

<p>The soldiers of the Sardinian King, defending
and attacking with fervor, continue
their skirmishes from early morning. The
hills of San Martino, Roccolo, Madonno della
Scoperta are captured and recaptured five
or six times. Their Generals Mollard, La
Marmora, Della Rocca, Durando, Fanti,
Cialdini, Cucchiari, de Sonnoz, with all
kinds and all grades of officers help the king
before whose eyes lie the wounded Generals
Cedale, Perrier and Arnoldi.</p>

<p>The French Emperor orders that the corps
of Baraguey d'Hilliers and MacMahon, together
with the Imperial Guard, attack at
the same time the fortress of San Cassiano
and occupy Solferino.</p>

<p>But the brave Austrians make the allied
army pay dearly for its success....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
One of its heroes, Prince Aleksandro de Hessen,
after fighting with great courage at
San Cassiano defends against repeated attacks,
the three heights of Mount Fontana....
At Guidizzolo, Prince Charles of
Windischraetz, braves certain death in seeking
to recapture under a hail of balls Casa
Nova. Mortally wounded, he still commands,
supported and carried by his brave soldiers,
who vainly make for him a rampart of their
own bodies.</p>

<p>Marshal Baraguey d'Hilliers finally enters
the town of Solferino, courageously defended
by Baron Stadion.</p>

<p>The sky is darkened, dense clouds cover
the horizon. A furious wind is rising. It
carries away the broken branches of the
trees. A cold rain, driven by the tempest,
a veritable cloud-burst, drenches the combatants,
exhausted from hunger and fatigue,
while dust, hail and smoke are blinding the
soldiers forced to fight also the elements.</p>

<p>The army of the Emperor Francis Joseph
retreats. Throughout the entire action the
chief of the House of Hapsburg shows admirable
tranquillity and self-control.</p>

<p>During the capture of Cavriana the Austrian
Emperor finds himself, together with
Baron Schlick and the Prince of Nassau, on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
the adjacent heights, Madonna della Pieve,
opposite a church surrounded by cypress
trees. Towards evening, the Austrian center
having yielded and the left flank not daring
to hope to force the position of the allies, the
general retreat is decided. In this grave
moment, Emperor Francis Joseph, around
whom rained balls and bullets during the
whole day, goes with a part of his staff to
Volta, while the Archdukes and the hereditary
Grand Duke of Tuscany returned to
Valeggio.</p>

<p>The Austrian officers fought like lions.
Some, through despair, let themselves die,
but sold their lives dearly. The greater
number rejoin their regiments covered with
the blood of their own wounds or with that
of the enemy. To their bravery should be
rendered merited praise.</p>

<p>... Guidizzolo remains occupied
by the Austrians until ten o'clock in the evening....
The roads are covered with
army wagons, carts and reserve artillery.
The transport vans are saved by the rapid
construction of improvised bridges. The
first Austrian wounded consisting of men
slightly injured, commence to enter Villafranca.
The more seriously wounded follow
them. Austrian physicians and their assistants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
rapidly bandage the wounds, give some
nourishment to the wounded and send them
by railroad trains to Verona, where the embarrassment
is becoming terrible.</p>

<p>Although during its retreat the Austrian
army tries to carry away all the wounded
which it could transport (and with what
great suffering!), nevertheless, thousands remain
lying on the ground moistened with
their blood.</p>

<p>The allied army is in possession of the conquered
field.</p>

<p>Near the close of the day when the evening
shadows creep over this vast field of
carnage, more than one officer, more than
one French soldier, seek here and there a
comrade, a compatriot, or a friend, when
he finds the wounded friend, he kneels beside,
trying to restore him to consciousness, wiping
away the blood, bandaging the wounds
as well as he can, wrapping a handkerchief
around the broken limb, but rarely can he
secure water for the suffering man.</p>

<p>How many silent tears were shed during
this sad night, when all false pride, all human
regard were set aside.</p>

<p>During the battle, hospitals for the
wounded established in nearby farmhouses,
churches, monasteries, in the open air, under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the shade of trees receive the wounded
officers and non-commissioned officers, who
are hastily given treatment. After these
comes the turn of the soldiers, when that is
possible. Those of the latter who are still
able to walk find their way to the field hospitals.
The others are carried on litters and
stretchers, weakened as they are by loss of
blood, by pain, by continued lack of food,
and by the mental and moral shock they have
experienced. During the battle a pennant
fixed on an elevation marks the station for
the wounded and the field hospitals of the
fighting regiments. Unfortunately, only a
few of the soldiers know the color of the hospital
pennant or that of the hospital flag of
the enemy, for the colors differ with the
different nations. The bombs fall upon them,
sparing neither physicians, nor wounded,
nor wagons loaded with bread, wine, meat
or lint.</p>

<p>The heights which extend from Castiglione
to Volta, sparkle with thousands of fires,
which are fed by pieces of Austrian gun-wagons
and by huge branches of trees,
broken by the tempest or by cannon balls.
The soldiers dry their dripping clothes; then,
overcome by fatigue and exhaustion, they fall
asleep on the stones or on the ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>What terrible episodes! What touching
scenes! What disillusionments!</p>

<p>There are battalions without food, companies
lacking almost every necessity, because
of the loss of the knapsacks. Water
also is lacking, but their thirst is so intense
that officers and soldiers resort to slimy and
even bloody pools. Everywhere the wounded
are begging for water.</p>

<p>Through the silence of the night are heard
groans, stifled cries of anguish and pain,
and heartrending voices calling for help.</p>

<p>Who will ever be able to paint the agonies
of this horrible night!</p>

<p>The sun on the twenty-fifth of June, 1859,
shines above one of the most frightful sights
imaginable. The battle-field is everywhere
covered with corpses of men and horses.
They appear as if sown along the roads, in
the hollows, the thickets and the fields, above
all, near the village of Solferino.</p>

<p>The fields ready for the harvest are ruined,
the grain trodden down, the fences overturned,
the orchards destroyed.</p>

<p>Here and there one finds pools of blood.</p>

<p>The villages are deserted. They bear
traces of bullets, of bombs and shells and
grenades.</p>

<p>The houses whose walls have been pierced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
with bullets and are gaping widely, are
shaken and ruined.</p>

<p>The inhabitants, of whom the greater
number have passed almost twenty hours in
the refuge of their cellars, without light or
food, are commencing to come out. The look
of stupor of these poor peasants bears testimony
to the long terror they have endured.</p>

<p>The ground is covered with all kinds of
debris, broken pieces of arms, articles of
equipments and blood-stained clothing.</p>

<p>The miserable wounded gathered up during
the day are pale, livid and inert.</p>

<p>Some, principally those seriously injured,
have a vacant look, they seem not to understand
what is said to them. They turn their
staring eyes toward those who bring them
help.</p>

<p>Others, in a dangerous state of nervous
shock, are shaking with convulsive tremblings.</p>

<p>Still others, with uncovered wounds,
where inflammation has already appeared,
seem frenzied with pain; they beg that someone
may end their sufferings, and, with
drawn faces, writhe in the last torments of
agony.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, poor fellows are prostrated on
the ground by bullets and bursting shells.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
Their arms and legs have been fractured by
the cannon wheels that have passed over
them.</p>

<p>The shock of the cylindrical ball shatters
the bones, so that the wound it causes is always
very dangerous. The bursting of shells
and the conical balls make extremely painful
fractures, the internal injury being terrible.
Every kind of pieces of bone, of earth, of
lead, of clothing, of equipments, of shoes,
aggravate and irritate the wounds of the
patients and increase their sufferings.</p>

<p>Those who cross this vast field of yesterday's
battle meet at every step, in the midst
of a confusion without parallel, inexpressible
despair and suffering of every kind.</p>

<p>Some of the battalions which had taken off
their knapsacks during the battle, at last
find them again, but they have been robbed
of all their contents. During the night, vagabonds
have stolen everything. A grave loss
to the poor men whose linen and uniforms
are stained and torn. Not only do they find
themselves deprived of their clothing, but
even their smallest savings, all their fortune
as well as of the treasures dear to them;
small family mementoes given by mothers,
sisters and sweethearts.</p>

<p>In several places the dead are stripped of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
their clothing by the thieves, who do not always
spare the wounded who are still living.</p>

<p>Besides these painful sights are others still
more dramatic.</p>

<p>Here the old, retired General Le Breton
wanders, seeking his son-in-law, the
wounded General Douay, who has left his
daughter, Madame Douay, in the midst of
the tumult of war, in a state of the most
cruel uneasiness. There, Colonel de Maleville,
shot at Casa Nova, expires. Here, it is
Colonel de Genlis, whose dangerous wound
causes a burning fever. There, Lieutenant
de Selve of the artillery, only a few weeks
out of Saint Cyr, has his right arm amputated
on the battle-field, where he was
wounded.</p>

<p>I help care for a poor sergeant-major of
the Vincennes Chasseurs, both of whose legs
are pierced through with balls. I meet him
again in the Brescia Hospital; but he will
die crossing Mount Cenis.</p>

<p>Lieutenant de Guiseul, who was believed
dead, is picked up on the spot, where, having
fallen with his standard, he was lying in a
swoon. The courageous sub-lieutenant
Fournier, of the flying-guard, gravely
wounded, finishes in his twentieth year a
military career commenced in his tenth year<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
by voluntarily enlisting in the foreign legion.
They bury the Commander de Pontgibaud,
who died during the night, and the young
Count de Saint Paer, who had attained the
rank of major hardly seven days before.
General Auger, of the artillery, is carried to
the field hospital of Casa Morino. His left
shoulder has been shattered by a six-inch
shell, part of which remained imbedded for
twenty-four hours in the interior of the
muscles of the armpit. Carried to Castiglione
he is attacked with gangrene, and dies
as a result of the disarticulation of the arm.
General de Ladmirault and General Dieu,
both gravely wounded, also arrived at Castiglione.</p>

<p>The lack of water becomes greater and
greater. The sun is burning, the ditches are
dried up. The soldiers have only brackish
and unwholesome water to appease their
thirst. Where even the least little stream
or spring trickling drop by drop is found,
guards with loaded guns have great difficulty
in preserving this water for the most urgent
needs.</p>

<p>Wounded horses, who have lost their riders,
and have wandered during the whole
night, drag themselves to their comrades,
from whom they seem to beg for help. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
are put out of their agony by a bullet. One
of these noble chargers comes alone into the
midst of a French company. The rich saddle-bag,
fastened to the saddle, shows that it
belongs to Prince von Isenberg. Afterwards,
the wounded Prince himself is found; but
careful nursing during a serious illness will
allow him to return to Germany, where his
family, in ignorance of the truth, have believed
him dead and have mourned for him.</p>

<p>Among the dead some have peaceful faces;
these are the men who were struck suddenly
and died at once. But those who did not
perish immediately have their limbs rigid
and twisted in agony, their bodies are covered
with dirt; their hands clutch the earth,
their eyes are open and staring, a convulsive
contraction has uncovered their clenched
teeth.</p>

<p>Three days and three nights are passed in
burying the dead who are left on the battle-field.</p>

<p>On so large a field, many of the corpses
hidden in the ditches, covered by the thickets
or by some uneveness of the ground are
discovered very late. They, as well as the
dead horses, emit a fetid stench.</p>

<p>In the French army a number of soldiers
from each company are detailed to recognize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
and bury the dead. As far as possible soldiers
of the same corps must pick up their
fellow-members. They write down the number
stamped on the clothing of the dead.
Then, aided in this painful duty by paid
Lombardy peasants, they put the corpses in
a common grave. Unfortunately, it is possible
that, because of the unavoidable rapidity
in this labor, and because of the carelessness
and inattention of the paid workmen,
more than one living man is buried with the
dead.</p>

<p>The letters, papers, orders, money,
watches found on the officers are sent to
their families, but the great number of the
interred bodies make the faithful accomplishment
of this task impossible.</p>

<p>A son, the idol of his parents, educated
and cared for during many years by a loving
mother who was uneasy at the very
slightest indisposition. A brilliant officer,
beloved by his family, having left at home
his wife and children. A young soldier who
has just left his betrothed and his mother,
sisters and old father; there he lies in the
mud and in the dust, soaked in his own blood.
Because of the wound in his head his face
has become unrecognizable. He is in agony,
he expires in cruel suffering, and his body,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
black, swollen, hideous, thrown in a shallow
grave, is covered with a little lime and earth.
The birds of prey will not respect his feet
and hands protruding from the muddy
ground of the slope which serves him as a
tomb. Someone will come back, will carry
more earth there and, perhaps, will put up
a wooden cross above the place where his
body rests, and that will be all.</p>

<p>The corpses of the Austrians, clothed in
mud-stained cloaks, torn linen jackets, white
tunics stained with blood are strewn by
thousands on the hills and plains of Medole.
Clouds of crows fly over the bodies in hopes
of having them for prey.</p>

<p>By hundreds they are crowded into a great
common grave.</p>

<p>Once out of the line of fire, Austrian soldiers,
slightly wounded, young first-year recruits,
throw themselves on the ground from
fatigue and inanition, then weakened by
loss of blood, they die miserably from exhaustion
and hunger.</p>

<p>Unhappy mothers in Austria, Hungary
and Bohemia, your sorrow will be great
when you learn that your children died in
the enemy's country, without care, without
help, and without consolation!</p>

<p>The lot of the Austrian prisoners-of-war<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
is very sad. Led like simple cattle, they are
sent in a crowd, with a strong guard, to
Brescia, where they at last find repose, if
not a kind welcome.</p>

<p>Some French soldiers wish to do violence
to the Hungarian captives whom they take
for Croates, adding furiously that those
"Glued-pantalooners," as they called them,
always killed the wounded. I succeeded in
tearing from their hands these unfortunate,
trembling captives.</p>

<p>On the battle-field many Austrians are
permitted to keep their swords. They have
the same food as the French officers. Some
troops of the allied army fraternally divide
their biscuits with the famished prisoners.
Some even take the wounded on their backs
and carry them to the ambulances. Near me
the lieutenant of the guard bandages with
his white handkerchief the head of a Tyrolese
which was scarcely covered with old,
torn, and dirty linen.</p>

<p>During the previous day at the height
of the battle, Commandant de la Rochefoucauld-Liancourt,
the fearless African hunter,
threw himself upon a squad of Hungarians;
but his horse having been pierced through
with balls, he himself was struck by two
shots and made prisoner by the Hungarians.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
Learning that wounded La Rochefoucauld
had been captured by the soldiers, the Austrian
Emperor ordered that he be treated
with great kindness and given the best care.</p>

<p>The commissary continue to pick up the
wounded. These, bandaged or not, are carried
by mules or wheelbarrows and litters
to the field hospitals in the villages and
towns near the place where they fell.</p>

<p>In these towns, churches, monasteries,
houses, parks, courts, streets and promenades
are transformed into improvised hospitals.</p>

<p>In Carpenedolo, Castel-Goffredo, Medole,
Guidizzolo, Volta and neighboring places are
arriving many of the wounded. But the
greater number are carried to Castiglione,
where the least mutilated have already succeeded
in dragging themselves.</p>

<p>Behold the long procession of vehicles of
the Commissary Department, loaded with
soldiers, non-commissioned officers and officers
of all grades mixed together; cavalry-men,
infantry, artillerymen, bleeding,
fatigued, lacerated, covered with dust. Each
jolt of the wagons which carry them imposing
on them new suffering.</p>

<p>Then the mules come trotting in, their
gait drawing, each instant, bitter cries from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
the throats of the unfortunate wounded
whom they are bearing.</p>

<p>Many die during the transportation.</p>

<p>Their corpses are put on the sides of the
roads. To others is left the duty of burying
them. These dead are enscribed, "Disappeared."</p>

<p>The wounded are sent to Castiglione.
From there they are carried on to the hospitals
in Brescia, Cremona, Bergama, Milan,
and other cities of Lombardy, where they
will receive the regular care and will submit
to the necessary amputations. But as the
means of transportation are very scarce,
they are obliged to wait several days in
Castiglione. This city, where the confusion
surpasses all imagination, soon becomes for
the French and Austrians a vast temporary
hospital.</p>

<p>On the day of battle the field-hospital of
headquarters is established there. Chests of
lint are unpacked, dressings for wounds and
medicate necessities are prepared. The inhabitants
give everything that they can get
ready&mdash;coverings, linens, mattresses and
straw.</p>

<p>The Hospital of Castiglione, the monastery,
the Barracks of San Luigi, the Church
of the Capucines, the stations of the police,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
the churches of Maggiore, San Giuseppe,
Santa Rosalie, are filled with the wounded
lying crowded on the straw.</p>

<p>Straw is also arranged for them in the
courts and in the public parks. Plank roofs
are quickly put up and linen is stretched to
protect them from the hot sun.</p>

<p>The private dwellings are soon converted
into hospitals. Officers and soldiers are there
received by the inhabitants.</p>

<p>Some of these last run through the streets
anxiously searching for a physician for their
guests. Later, others, in consternation, go
and come through the city, insistently begging
that someone take away from their
houses the corpses with which they do not
know what to do.</p>

<p>A number of French surgeons, having remained
in Castiglione, aided by young Italian
physicians and by hospital orderlies, dress
and bandage the wounds.</p>

<p>But all this is very insufficient.</p>

<p>The number of convoys of wounded becomes
so great during Saturday that the administration,
the citizens and the few soldiers
left in Castiglione are incapable of
caring for so much misery.</p>

<p>Then, melancholy scenes occur. There is
water; there is food; and nevertheless the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
wounded are dying of hunger and thirst.
There is much lint, but not enough hands to
put it on the wounds! The greater number
of the army of physicians must go to Cavriana;
the hospital orderlies make mistakes,
and hands are lacking at this critical moment.</p>

<p>A voluntary service, good or bad, must be
organized. But this is difficult in the midst
of such disorder, to which is added a panic
of the Castiglionians, which results in aggravating
the misery of the wounded. This
panic is caused by a very insignificant circumstance.</p>

<p>As each corps of the French army had
recovered itself, after taking up its position,
on the day after the battle, convoys of prisoners
were formed who were sent to Brescia,
through Castiglione and Montechiaro. The
inhabitants took one band of captives coming
from Cavriana escorted by hussars, for the
Austrian army returning in force. Alarm
was given by the frightened peasants, by the
assistant conductors of the baggage, by
itinerant merchants who follow the troops
in a campaign.</p>

<p>Immediately all the houses are closed, the
inhabitants barricading themselves in their
homes, burning the tri-color flags which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
adorned their windows, hiding themselves
in the cellars or the attics. Some run into
the fields with their wives and children
carrying with them their most valuable possessions.
Others, less frightened and more
sagacious, remain at home, but take in the
first Austrian wounded upon whom they lay
their hands and overwhelm them with kindness
and care.</p>

<p>In the streets, on the roads, blocked by
wagonloads of wounded, by convoys of supplies,
are rapid transport wagons, horses flying
in all directions, amid cries of fear, of
anger and of pain. Baggage wagons are
overturned, bread and biscuits fall into the
gutter. The drivers detach the horses,
dashing away with hanging bridles on the
road to Brescia, spreading the alarm as they
go. They collide with carts of provisions
and convoys of wounded. These latter, trodden
under foot and frenzied with terror, beg
to be taken with them. In the city some of
them deaf to all orders tear away their bandages,
go staggering out of the churches, into
the streets where they are jostled and bruised
and finally fall from exhaustion and pain.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What agonies! What suffering during the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
days of June twenty-fifth, twenty-sixth and
twenty-seventh!</p>

<p>Wounds poisoned by heat, by dust and by
lack of water and care, have become intensely
painful.</p>

<p>Suffocating stenches pollute the air in
spite of efforts to keep in good condition
these local hospitals.</p>

<p>Every quarter of an hour the convoys sent
to Castiglione are bringing new loads of
wounded. The insufficiency in the number
of assistants, of hospital orderlies, of servants
is cruelly felt.</p>

<p>In spite of the activity of the Commissary
Department, which is organizing transportation
to Brescia by means of ox-carts; in spite
of the spontaneous care of the inhabitants
of Castiglione, who transport the sick, the
departures are much less numerous than the
arrivals, and the crowding grows unceasingly
greater.</p>

<p>On the stone floors of the churches of
Castiglione are placed, side by side, men of
every nation. French, Germans, Slavs and
Arabs are temporarily crowded to the most
remote part of the chapels. Many have no
longer the strength to move themselves and
cannot move or stir in the narrow space
where they are lying. Oaths, blasphemies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and cries which can be interpreted by no expression,
are sounding beneath the arches of
the sanctuaries.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, how I suffer!" say to me some
of these poor fellows. "We are abandoned,
left to die miserably, and yet we fought
bravely!" They can get no rest, in spite of
the nights they have passed in sleeplessness
and long-endured fatigue. In their distress
they beg for help which is not given. Some,
in despair, roll in convulsions which will
end in tetanus and death. Others, believing
that the cold water poured on their festered
wounds produce worms, which appear in
great numbers, refuse to have the bandages
moistened. Others still, whose wounds were
dressed at the improvised hospitals on the
battle-fields, are given no further attention
during the halt they are obliged to make in
Castiglione, and as these bandages are very
tight, in view of the roughness of the transportation
and have not been changed, they
are suffering veritable tortures.</p>

<p>These, whose faces are black with flies,
with which the air is infested and which
cling to their wounds, cast on all sides distracted
glances. But no one notices. On
these, the cloaks, shirts, flesh and blood form
a compact mass that cannot be removed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span></p>

<p>Here, lies a soldier totally disfigured; his
tongue hanging far out of his broken jaws.
He stirs and wishes to rise. I moisten his
dried palate and hardened tongue. Seizing a
handful of lint I soak it in a bucket and
squeeze the water from this improvised
sponge in the formless opening which is in
the place of his mouth.</p>

<p>There, is an unfortunate man a part of
whose face, the nose, lips and chin have
been cut away by the stroke of a sword. Incapable
of speech, half blind, he makes signs
with his hands, and by that heartrending
pantomime, accompanied by guttural sounds,
draws attention to himself. I give him a
drink by dropping gently on his blood-covered
face a little pure water.</p>

<p>A third, with a cleft head, expires, his
blood spreading over the stone floor of the
church. He presents a horrible sight. His
companions in misfortune push him with
their feet, for he incommodes the passage.
I protect his last moments and cover with a
handkerchief his poor head which he still
feebly moves.</p>

<p>Although every house has become an infirmary,
and every family has dedicated itself
to nursing the wounded officers, that it
has gathered in, nevertheless I succeed by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Sunday morning in collecting a certain number
of women of the people, who assist, as
best they can, in the efforts made to help so
many thousands of wounded men who are
without succor. Food must be given, and
above all, drink, to the men who literally are
dying from hunger and thirst. Wounds must
be bandaged, blood-stained bodies, covered
all over with dirt and vermin, must be
washed, and all this must be done in the extremely
hot weather, in the midst of the
suffocating, nauseating stench, and of groans
and cries of pain.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, a little group of volunteers
is formed. I organize, well as I can, aid in
the section which seems to be the most without
care, and I choose one of the churches of
Castiglione, called Chiesa Maggiore.</p>

<p>Nearly five hundred soldiers are crowded
together on the straw, about one hundred
others, suffering and groaning, are lying in
the public park before the church.</p>

<p>In the church the women of Lombardy go
from one to the other with jars and pitchers
full of clear water, which serves to appease
the thirst and to bathe the wounds. Some
of these improvised nurses are good-hearted
old women, others are charming young girls.
Their gentleness, goodness, compassion, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
their attentive care restores a little courage
to the wounded.</p>

<p>The boys of the neighborhood come and
go between the church and the nearby
springs with buckets, pitchers and jars.</p>

<p>The distribution of water is followed by
that of bouillon and soup, of which the servants
of the Commissary Department are
obliged to cook a marvelous quantity.</p>

<p>Thick bundles of lint are placed here and
there. Everyone can use it freely; but
bandages, linen and shirts are lacking, and
one can hardly procure the most necessary
articles. I purchase, however, some new
shirts by the aid of those kind-hearted
women who have already given all their old
linen; and, on Monday, early in the morning,
I send my coachman to Brescia to bring
back supplies. He returns after some hours
with his cabriolet loaded with sponges, linen,
pins, cigars, tobacco, camomile, mallow, sambuca,
oranges, sugar and lemons.</p>

<p>This makes it possible to give refreshing
lemonade, wash the wounds with mallow-water,
put on warm compresses and renew
the material of the bandages.</p>

<p>In the meantime we have gained some recruits,
who help us. The first is an old naval
officer, then some English tourists, who, desiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
to see everything, have entered the
church, and whom we keep almost by force.
Two other Englishmen, on the contrary,
show themselves desirous to help. They distribute
cigars to the Austrians. An Italian
priest, three or four travelers, a Swiss merchant
from Neuchatel, a Parisian journalist,
who afterwards takes charge of the relief in
the adjacent church, and some officers whose
company has received orders to remain in
Castiglione, also aid us.</p>

<p>But soon some of those voluntary nurses
go away, not being able to bear the sight of
this suffering. The priest follows their example,
but he reappears, however, with delicate
kindness to make us smell aromatic
herbs and bottles of salts. A tourist, oppressed
at the sight of these living debris,
swooned from emotion. The merchant from
Neuchatel perseveres for two days, bandaging
wounds and writing for the dying letters
of farewell to their families. We are obliged
to quiet the compassionate excitement of a
Belgian, fearing that he will have an attack
of burning fever.</p>

<p>Some men of the detachment, left to garrison
the city, try to help their comrades, but
cannot endure the sight which breaks down
their courage, striking too keenly upon their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
imagination. Nevertheless, a corporal of the
engineer corps, wounded at Magenta, almost
restored to health and about to return to his
battalion, but whose orders leave him a few
days of liberty, aids us with courage and
perseverance.</p>

<p>The French Commissary, remaining in
Castiglione, finally grants, on my insistence,
authority to utilize for service in the hospitals,
some healthy prisoners, and three or
four Austrian physicians who aid the efforts
of the few surgeons left in Castiglione.</p>

<p>A German physician remaining voluntarily
on the battle-field to care for the soldiers,
dedicates himself to the injured of
both armies. After three days the Commissary
sends him back to Mantua to rejoin his
compatriots.</p>

<p>"Do not leave me to die," exclaim some of
these agonized men seizing my hand in despair,
but their death is not long delayed.</p>

<p>"Ah, sir, if you would write to my father,
that he might console my poor mother!" said
to me, with tears in his eyes, a corporal
named Mazuet, scarcely twenty years old. I
noted down the address of his parents and
a few minutes later he had ceased to live.
The parents, who dwelt on rue d'Alger, in
Lyons, and of whom this young man, enlisted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
as a volunteer, was the only son, received no
other information about their child than that
which I sent to them. He very probably,
like so many others, has been enscribed,
"disappeared."</p>

<p>An old sergeant, decorated with many
chevrons, repeated with profound melancholy
and an air of conviction full of bitterness:
"If someone had cared for me sooner,
I should have lived, whereas, this evening I
will die." That evening he died.</p>

<p>"I do not want to die! I do not want to
die!" cries, with savage energy, a grenadier
of the guard, full of strength and health
three days before, but who, mortally
wounded, and feeling sure that his minutes
are irrevocably numbered, fights against this
dark certainty. I talk to him, he listens to
me, and this man, calmed, soothed, consoled,
finally resigns himself to die with the simplicity
of a child.</p>

<p>In the back of the church, on the steps of
an altar, a Chasseur d'Afrique lies on straw.
Three balls have struck him, one on the right
side, one on the left shoulder, the third remained
in the right leg. It is Sunday, and
he asserts that he has eaten nothing since
Friday. He is covered with dried mud
flecked with blood, his clothing is torn; his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
shirt is in tatters. After I had washed his
wounds, given him a little bouillon and wrapped
him in covers, he put my hand to his lips
with an expression of unspeakable gratitude.
Later we were able to send him to a better
hospital.</p>

<p>At the entrance of the church is a Hungarian
who cries unceasingly, calling in
heartrending tones for a physician. His
back and his shoulders, ploughed with grapeshot,
appear as if torn by iron hooks and are
one mass of quivering, raw flesh. The rest
of his body is swollen, green and black&mdash;horrible.
He can neither lie down nor sit up.
I dip some packages of lint in cool water and
try to make a cushion for him, but gangrene
soon carries him off.</p>

<p>A little further on lies a dying Zouave
who is weeping bitter tears, and we console
him as if he were a little child. The preceding
fatigue, the lack of food and repose,
the intensity of the pain, the fear of dying
without help, excites even in these brave soldiers
a nervous sensibility which betrays
itself by sobs. One of their chief thoughts,
when they are not suffering too cruelly, is the
memory of their mother, and the fear of the
grief she will experience on learning of their
fate. On the corpse of a soldier we found,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
hanging from his neck, a medallion containing
the portrait of an aged woman, without
doubt his mother, which with his left hand
he was pressing on his heart.</p>

<p>In the part nearest the great door of the
church Maggiore lie, now, on straw, enveloped
in covers, about a hundred French non-commissioned
officers and soldiers. They are
ranged in two nearly parallel ranks, between
which one can pass. Their wounds have
been dressed. The distribution of soup has
taken place. They are quiet. They follow
me with their eyes; all heads turn to the
left if I go to the left, to the right when I go
to the right. Sincere thanks are visible on
their astonished faces. "One can easily see
that he is a Parisian," say some. "No," retort
others, "he seems to be a Southerner."
"Truly, sir, are you not from Bordeaux?"
asks a third, and each wishes that I might be
from his city or province. I met afterwards
some of these wounded men, who had become
crippled invalids. Recognizing me, they
stopped to express their gratitude because
I had nursed them in Castiglione. "We
called you 'the gentleman in white,'" said
one, in his picturesque language, "for you
were always dressed entirely in white. It
is true the weather did not fail to be hot."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>The resignation of the poor soldiers was
often touching; they suffered without complaint,
they died humbly and silently.</p>

<p>On the other side of the church, some
wounded Austrian prisoners fear to receive
care which they distrust. They angrily tear
off their bandages, opening their bleeding
wounds. Others remain silent, dejected, impassive.
But the greater number are far
from being insensible to kindness and their
faces express their thanks. One of them,
about nineteen years of age, who with forty
of his compatriots is pushed into the deep
recesses of the church, has been without food
for two days. He has lost one eye, he trembles
with fever, he is scarcely able to speak
or to drink a little bouillon. Our nursing revives
him; twenty-four hours later when we
are able to send him to Brescia, he leaves us
with sorrow, almost with despair, pressing
to his lips the hands of the good-hearted
women of Castiglione, whom he entreats not
to abandon him.</p>

<p>Another prisoner, a prey to a burning
fever, draws attention to himself. He is not
yet twenty years of age and his hair is already
perfectly white; it became white during
the battle, as his wounded comrades near
whom he lies assure us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></p>

<p>The women of Castiglione, seeing that I
make no distinction in nationality, imitate
my example, showing the same kindness to
all these men of such different origin and
who are to them all equally strangers. "Tutti
Fratelli," they repeat with compassion. "All
are brothers."</p>

<p>Honor to these compassionate women, to
these young girls of Castiglione! As devoted
as they are modest, they give way neither
before fatigue, nor disgust, nor sacrifice;
nothing repels, wearies or disheartens them.</p>

<p>For the soldier recommencing the everyday
life of the campaign, after the fatigue
and emotions of a battle like that of Solferino,
the memories of his family become
more strong than ever. That mental state is
vividly described by the following lines from
an officer writing from Volta to his brother
in France:</p>

<p>"You cannot imagine how the soldiers are
moved when they catch sight of the baggage-master
who distributes the letters to the
army; because he brings to us, understand,
news from France, from our native land,
from our parents, from our friends. Each
one listens, watches, and stretches to him
eager hands. The happy men, who receive
a letter&mdash;open it hurriedly and devour it immediately;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
the rest, deprived of this happiness,
depart with heavy heart and isolate
themselves in order to think about those so
far away.</p>

<p>"Sometimes a name is called to which there
is no response. The men glance at each
other, they question among themselves, they
wait. 'Dead,' murmurs a voice, and the
baggage-master files the letter away and returns
it unopened to the writer. They had
rejoiced when they sent it, and had said to
one another. 'He will be happy to receive
it!' When they see it returned, their poor
hearts will break."</p>

<p>The streets of Castiglione are quieter;
the deaths and the departures have left
vacancies.</p>

<p>In spite of the arrival of new wagons full
of wounded, order, little by little, is established
and regular attendance commences.</p>

<p>The convoys from Castiglione to Brescia
are more frequent. They consist principally
of hospital wagons and heavy carts which,
constantly carrying, to the French Commissary
Department, gun supplies, and provisions,
go back empty to Brescia.</p>

<p>They are drawn by oxen, walking slowly
under the fierce sun and through the thick
dust in which the pedestrian sinks to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
ankles. These uncomfortable wagons are
covered with branches of trees which very
imperfectly protect from the rays of the
coming sun. The wounded, piled up, one
may say, one upon another. It is difficult to
imagine the torments of this long ride.</p>

<p>In these wagons some groan, others call
for their mother; there are the ravings and
delirium of fever, sometimes curses and
blasphemies.</p>

<p>The least interest shown to these unhappy
men, a kind salutation, gives them pleasure
and they return it at once with expressions
of gratitude.</p>

<p>In all the villages along the road leading
to Brescia, the women sitting before their
doors, silently prepare lint. The Communal
authorities have had prepared, drinks, bread
and nourishment. When a convoy arrives
the women of the village go to the wagons,
wash the wounds, renew the lint compresses,
which they moisten with fresh water. They
pour spoonfuls of bouillon, wine or lemonade
in the mouths of those who have not the
strength to raise their heads or extend their
arms.</p>

<p>In Montechiaro, three small hospitals are
under the care of the women of the people,
who nurse with as much wisdom as kindheartedness.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
In Guidizzolo, about one thousand
invalids are placed in a large castle. In
Volta, some hundreds of Austrians are received
in an old monastery which has been
transformed into barracks. In Cavriana,
they establish in the church a number of
Hungarians who had been forty-eight hours
without help. In the field-hospital of the
headquarters, chloroform is used in operating;
this produces, in the Austrians, almost
immediate insensibility, and in the French
nervous contractions, accompanied by exaltation
before unconsciousness results.</p>

<p>The people of Cavriana are entirely without
provisions; the soldiers of the guard feed
them by sharing with them their rations and
their mess; the country has been laid waste,
and almost everything edible, cattle, garden
produce, etc., has been sold to the Austrian
troops. The French army has campaign
food in abundance, but only with difficulty
can it procure the butter, meat and vegetables
necessary for the ordinary food of
soldiers.</p>

<p>The wounded of the Sardinian army, who
have been transported to Desenzano, Rivoltella,
Lonato, and Pozzolenzo, are in conditions
less disadvantageous than the French
and Austrians temporarily established in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Castiglione&mdash;Desenzano and Rivoltella not
having been occupied at a few days interval
by two different armies. Food is still to be
found there; the hospitals are better kept
and the inhabitants, less troubled, actively
support the nursing service. The sick are
sent to Brescia in good carts provided with
thick beds of hay. They are protected from
the sun by arches of interlaced foliage which
support a strong linen cover.</p>

<p>The feeling that one has of his own insufficiency
in such solemn circumstances, is an
inexpressible suffering. It is extremely painful
to feel that you cannot help all those who
lie before you, because of their great number,
or aid those who appeal to you with supplications.
Long hours pass before you
reach the most unfortunate. You are stopped
by one, petitioned by another, all equally
worthy of pity. Embarrassed at each step
by the multitude of miserable sufferers who
press about you, who surround you, who beg
support and help. Then, why turn to the left,
while on the right are so many men who will
soon die without a word of consolation,
without even a single glass of water to appease
their burning thirst? The thought of
the importance of one human life that one
might be able to save; the desire to alleviate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
the tortures of so many unfortunate and to
restore their courage, the forced and unceasing
activity which one imposes on himself
in such moments, gives a supreme energy, a
thirst to carry help to the greatest number
possible. One becomes no longer moved by
the thousand scenes of this terrible tragedy,
one passes, with indifference, before the most
hideously disfigured corpses and glances almost
coldly at sights, so much more horrible
than those already described, that the pen
refuses absolutely to depict them; but it happens,
sometimes, that the heart suddenly
breaks, struck all at once by a poignant sadness
at the sight of a single incident, an
isolated fact, an unexpected detail, which
goes directly to the soul, draws out our sympathy,
moves the most impressionable cords
of our being and brings a realization of the
whole horror of this tragedy.</p>

<p>Worn out with fatigue, but unable to sleep,
I have my little carriage harnessed on the
afternoon of Monday, the twenty-seventh,
and go away about 6 o'clock to breathe in the
open air the freshness of the evening and to
find a little repose by escaping, for a moment,
from the dismal sights which surround me
on every side in Castiglione.</p>

<p>It was a favorable time, for no movement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
of the troops had been ordered during the
day.</p>

<p>Calm had succeeded the terrible agitation
of the previous days. Here and there are
visible pools of dried blood which redden the
battle-field. One meets newly turned earth,
white with freshly strewn lime, indicating
the place where repose the victims of the
twenty-fourth.</p>

<p>At Solferino, whose square tower has
proudly dominated for some centuries that
country, where for the third time have just
met two of the greatest powers of modern
days, one still picks up much debris which
covers, even in the cemeteries, the crosses
and the bloody stones of the tombs. The
ground is strewn with swords, guns, haversacks,
cartridge boxes, tin boxes, shakos, helmets
and belts. Almost everything is twisted,
torn and broken.</p>

<p>I arrive at Cavriana at about 9 o'clock in
the evening.</p>

<p>The train of war surrounding the headquarters
of the Emperor of France is an
imposing sight.</p>

<p>I seek the Marshal, Duke of Magenta, with
whom I am personally acquainted.</p>

<p>Not knowing exactly where his army corps
is encamped, I stop my little carriage on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
park opposite the house occupied, since Friday
evening, by the Emperor Napoleon. I
find myself suddenly in the midst of a group
of generals, sitting on straw chairs and
wooden stools, smoking their cigars and inhaling
the fresh air before the improvised
palace of the Sovereign.</p>

<p>While I inquire about the location of Marshal
MacMahon, several generals, very suspicious
of my arrival, question the corporal,
wounded at Magenta, who begged permission
to accompany me on this excursion
through the armies as his rank would ensure
me safe conduct. Sitting beside the coachman,
he gives me, in a certain degree, official
character. The generals desire to know who
I am and to discover the object of the mission
with which they suppose I am charged,
for they cannot imagine that a simple traveler
would dare to risk himself alone in the
midst of the camps at such a time.</p>

<p>The corporal, who knows nothing, remains
impenetrable, while he replies respectfully to
their questions. Their curiosity increases
considerably when they see me leave for
Borghetto where the Duke of Magenta is.</p>

<p>The second corps, commanded by the Marshal,
has been moved from Cavriana to Castellaro,
which is at a distance of five kilometers;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
its divisions are encamped on the
right and left of the road leading from Castellaro
to Monzambano. The Marshal, himself,
with his staff, occupies Borghetto.</p>

<p>Although the night has arrived, we continue
our way. The fires of the bivouac, fed
by whole trees, and the lighted tents of the
officers, present a picturesque appearance.
The last murmurings of a sleeping, yet
watchful, camp soothes a little my excited
imagination. Under this beautiful star-lit
sky, a solemn silence at last takes the place of
the noises and emotions of the preceding
days. I breathe with delight the pure sweet
air of a splendid Italian night.</p>

<p>Having obtained only incomplete information,
we mistake our way and follow a road
leading to Volta. We are about to fall into
the army corps of General Neil, made Marshal
three days before, which is encamped
on the outskirts of the town.</p>

<p>My Italian coachman is so frightened at
the idea of being very near the Austrian
lines that, more than once, I am obliged to
take the reins from his hands and give them
to the corporal seated beside him on the box.
The poor man had run away from Mantua
several days before to save himself from the
Austrian service, taking refuge in Brescia,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
he hired out as a coachman. His fears grow
greater on hearing the discharge of a distant
gun, fired by someone who disappears in the
underbrush. After the retreat of the Austrian
army, many of the deserters hid themselves
in the cellars of the houses of the villages,
abandoned by their owners and partially
plundered. In order not to be captured,
they, at first, ate and drank in those underground
retreats, then, being at the end of
their resources and pressed by hunger, but
well armed, they ventured out at night.</p>

<p>The unhappy and terrified Mantuan can
no longer guide his horse. He constantly
turns his head, he casts affrighted glances at
all the thickets along the road, at all the
hedges and hovels, fearing, any moment, to
see emerge some hidden Austrians.</p>

<p>His fears increase at every turn of the
road and he almost swoons, when, in the
silence of the night we are surprised with a
shot from a guard, whom we do not see on
account of the darkness. His terror knows
no limit when we almost collide with a large,
wide open umbrella which we vaguely catch
sight of at the side of the road near a path
leading to Volta. That poor umbrella, riddled
with bullets and balls was, probably, a
part of the baggage of some canteen-woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
who had lost it during the storm of the
twenty-fourth.</p>

<p>We were retracing the road to reach
Borghetto. It was after 11 o'clock. We
were making the horse gallop and our modest
vehicle rolled across the space, almost without
noise, on to the Strato Cavallara, when
cries of "Who goes there? Who goes there?
Who goes there? or I fire," came like a bolt
from the mouth of an invisible sentinel.
"France," replies immediately a loud voice,
which adds, in giving his rank: "Corporal
in the First Engineer Corps, Company Seventh."
"Go on," is the reply. Without this
presence of mind of the corporal we would
have received a shot almost in the face.</p>

<p>Finally, at a quarter before twelve we
reach, without other adventure, the first
houses of Borghetto.</p>

<p>All is dark and silent. However, a light
shines on the ground floor of a house on the
principal street, where are at work in a low
room the accounting officers. Although embarrassed
in their work and very much
astonished at our appearance at such an
hour, they treat us very kindly. A paymaster,
Signor Outrey, gives me a cordial invitation
to be his guest. His orderly brings a
mattress on which I throw myself, completely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
dressed, to rest for several hours,
after drinking some excellent bouillon, which
seems to me the more delicious as I am
hungry and for several days have eaten nothing
even passable. I can sleep quietly, not
being, as in Castiglione, suffocated with
fetid exhalations and tormented with the
flies, which though satiated with corpses,
attack also the living.</p>

<p>The corporal and the driver settled themselves
simply in the carriage, remaining in
the street, but the unfortunate Mantuan, always
in great terror, could not shut his eyes
during the whole night and the next day he
was more dead than alive.</p>

<p>Tuesday, the twenty-eighth, at six in the
morning I was received most kindly by Marshal
MacMahon. At ten o'clock I was on the
way to Cavriana. Soon after I entered the
modest house, since historic, for there was
lodged the Emperor Napoleon.</p>

<p>At three o'clock in the afternoon I found
myself once more in the midst of the
wounded of Castiglione, who expressed their
joy at seeing me again.</p>

<p>The thirtieth of June I was in Brescia.</p>

<p>This city, so charming and picturesque, is
transformed, not into a large temporary
shelter for the wounded like Castiglione, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
into a vast hospital. Its two cathedrals, its
palaces, its churches, its monasteries, its colleges,
its barracks, in a word all its buildings
receive the victims of Solferino.</p>

<p>Fifteen thousand beds, of some sort, have
been improvised in forty-eight hours. The
inhabitants have done more than was ever
done before under similar circumstances.</p>

<p>In the centre of the city the old basilica,
"il Duomo recchio," contains a thousand
wounded. The people come to them in
crowds, women of every class bring them
quantities of oranges, jellies, biscuits and
delicacies. The humblest widow or the poorest
little old woman believes that she must
present her tribute of sympathy and her
modest offering.</p>

<p>Similar scenes occur in the new cathedral,
a magnificent temple of white marble, where
the wounded are taken by the hundreds. It
is the same in forty other buildings, churches
or hospitals which contain nearly twenty
thousand wounded.</p>

<p>The municipality of Brescia understood
the extraordinary duty imposed upon it by
such grave circumstances. With a permanent
existence it associates with itself the
best men of the town, who bring to it eager
co-operation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>In opening a monastery, a school, a church,
the municipality created, in a few hours, as
if by magic, hospitals with hundreds of beds,
vast kitchens, improvised laundries for linen
and everything that would be necessary.</p>

<p>These measures were taken with so much
courage that, after a few days, one was able
to admire the good order and regular management
of these hurriedly arranged hospitals.
The population of Brescia, which
was forty thousand, was suddenly almost
doubled by the great number of wounded and
sick. The physicians, numbering one hundred
and forty, displayed great self-devotion
during the whole duration of their fatiguing
service. They were helped by the medical
students and some volunteers. Aid committees
being organized, a special commission
was appointed to receive donations of bedding,
linen and provisions of all kinds; another
commission administered the depot or
central store house.</p>

<p>In the large rooms of the hospitals, the
officers are ordinarily separated from the soldiers.
The Austrians are not mixed with
the allies. The series of beds are all alike,
on the shelf above the bed of each soldier,
his uniform and military cap indicate to
which branch of the service he belongs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>They have commenced to refuse permission
for the crowd to enter, it embarrasses
and hinders the nurses.</p>

<p>At the side of soldiers, with resigned faces,
are others who murmur and complain. The
idea of an amputation scarcely frightens the
French soldier, because of his careless nature,
but he is impatient and irritable; the
Austrian, of a less thoughtless disposition,
is more inclined to be melancholy in his
isolation.</p>

<p>I find in these hospital wards some of our
wounded from Castiglione. They are better
cared for now, but their torments are not
ended.</p>

<p>Here, is one of the heroes of the Imperial
Flying Guard, wounded at Solferino. Shot
in the leg, he passed several days at Castiglione,
where I dressed his wounds for the
first time. He is stretched on a straw mattress;
the expression of his face denotes
profound suffering; his eyes are hollow and
shining; his great pallor gives evidence that
purulent fever has set in to complicate and
increase the gravity of his condition; his lips
are dry; his voice trembles; the assurance of
the brave man has given place to fear and
timidity; care even unnerves him; he is
afraid to have any one approach his poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
injured leg which the gangrene has already
attacked.</p>

<p>A French surgeon, who makes the amputations,
passes by his bed; the sick man,
whose touch is like burning iron, seizes his
hand and presses it in his own.</p>

<p>"Do not hurt me! My suffering is terrible!"
he cries.</p>

<p>But one must act, and without delay.
Twenty other wounded must be operated on
during the same morning, and one hundred
and fifty are waiting for bandages. One has
not time to pity a single case nor to await
the end of his hesitation. The surgeon, cool
and resolute, replies: "Let me do it." Then
he rapidly lifts the covering. The broken leg
is swollen double its natural size; from three
places flows a quantity of fetid pus, purple
stains prove that as an artery has been
broken, the sole remedy, if there is one, is
amputation.</p>

<p>Amputation! Terrible word for this poor
young man, who sees before him no other
alternative than an immediate death or the
miserable life of a cripple.</p>

<p>He has no time to prepare himself for the
last decision, and trembling with anguish,
he cries out in despair: "Oh! What are you
going to do?" The surgeon does not reply.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
"Nurse, carry him away, make haste!" he
says. But a heartrending cry bursts from
that panting breast; the unskilled nurse has
seized the motionless, yet sensitive, leg much
too near the wound; the broken bones penetrating
the flesh, has caused new torments to
the soldier whose hanging leg shakes with
the jolts of the transportation to the operating
room.</p>

<p>Fearful procession! It seems as if one
were leading a victim to death.</p>

<p>He lies finally on the operating table.
Nearby, on another table, a linen covers the
instruments. The surgeon, occupied with his
work, hears and sees only his operation. A
young army doctor holds the arms of the
patient, while the nurse seizes the healthy
leg and draws the invalid to the edge of the
table. At this the frightened man shrieks:
"Do not let me fall!" and he seizes convulsively
in his arms the young physician, ready
to support him and who pale from emotion
is himself almost equally distressed.</p>

<p>The operator, one knee on the floor and his
hand armed with the terrible knife, places
his arm about the gangrenous limb and cuts
the skin all around. A piercing cry sounds
through the hospital. The young physician,
face to face, with the tormented man can see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
on his contracted features every detail of his
atrocious agony.</p>

<p>"Courage," he says, in a low tone to the
soldier, whose hands he feels gripping his
back, "two minutes more and you will be
saved."</p>

<p>The doctor stands up again; he separates
the skin from the muscles which it covers,
leaving them bare; as he draws back the skin
he cuts away the flesh, then returning to the
attack, with a vigorous turn, he cuts away
every muscle to the bone; a torrent of blood
gushes out of the arteries, just opened, covering
the operator and flowing down on to
the floor.</p>

<p>Calm and expressionless, the rough operator
does not speak a word; but, suddenly, in
the midst of the silence reigning in the room,
he turns in anger to the awkward nurse, reproaching
him for not knowing how to press
on the arteries. This latter, inexperienced,
did not know how to prevent the hemorrhage
by applying his thumb properly on the
bleeding arteries.</p>

<p>The wounded man, overcome by suffering,
articulates feebly, "Oh! it is enough, let me
die!" and a cold sweat runs down his face.</p>

<p>But he must bear it still another minute,&mdash;a
minute which seems an eternity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>The young physician, ever full of sympathy,
counts the seconds as he watches sometimes
the operating surgeon, sometimes the
patient, whose courage he tries to sustain,
saying to him: "Only one minute more!"</p>

<p>Indeed, the moment for the saw has come
and already one hears the grinding of the
steel as it penetrates the living bone, separating
from the body the member half
gangrenous.</p>

<p>But the pain has been too great for that
weak, exhausted body; the groans have
ceased, for the sick man has swooned. The
surgeon, who is no longer guided by his cries
and his groans, fearing that this silence may
be that of death, looks at him uneasily to
assure himself that he has not expired.</p>

<p>The restoratives, held in reserve, succeed,
with difficulty, in reviving his dull, half-closed,
vacant eyes. The dying man, however,
seems to return to life, he is weak and
shattered, but at least his greatest sufferings
are over.</p>

<p>Imagine such an operation on an Austrian,
understanding neither Italian nor French
and letting himself be led like a sheep or an
ox to slaughter without being able to exchange
one word with his well-meaning tormentors!
The French meet everywhere with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
sympathy; they are flattered, pampered, encouraged;
when one speaks to them about the
battle of Solferino, they brighten up and
discuss it: That memory, full of glory for
them; drawing their thoughts elsewhere
than on themselves, lessens a little their unhappiness.
But the Austrians have not this
good fortune. In the hospitals where they
are crowded, I insist upon seeing them and
almost by force enter their rooms. With
what gratitude these good men welcome my
words of consolation and the gift of a little
tobacco! On their resigned faces is depicted
a lively gratitude, which they do not know
how to express. Their looks tell more than
any word of thanks.</p>

<p>Some of them possess two or three paper
florins, a small fortune for them, but they
cannot change this modest value for coins.</p>

<p>The officers particularly show hearty appreciation
of the attentions bestowed upon
them. In the hospital where he is lodged,
Prince von Isenburg occupies with another
German prince, a comfortable little room.</p>

<p>During several successive days I distribute,
without distinction of nationality,
tobacco, pipes and cigars in the churches and
hospitals where the odor of the tobacco lessens
a little the nauseous stench produced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
by the crowding of so many patients in
suffocating places. Besides that, it is a distraction,
a means of dispelling the fears of
the wounded before the amputation of a
member; not a few are operated on with a
pipe in the mouth, and some die smoking.</p>

<p>Finally all the supply of tobacco in Brescia
is exhausted. It must be brought from
Milan.</p>

<p>An eminent inhabitant of Brescia, Signor
Carlo Borghetti, takes me in his carriage,
from hospital to hospital. He helps me to
distribute my modest gifts of tobacco, arranged
by the merchants in thousands of
little bags that are carried by willing soldiers
in very large baskets.</p>

<p>Everywhere I am well received. Only a
doctor of Lombardy, named Calini, will not
allow the distribution of cigars in the hospital
San Luca, which is confided to his care.
In other places the physicians, on the contrary,
show themselves almost as grateful as
their patients. But wishing to try once more
at San Luca, I visit again that hospital and
succeed in making a large distribution of
cigars, to the great joy the poor wounded,
whom I had innocently made suffer the
torments of Tantalus.</p>

<p>During the course of my investigations I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
penetrate into a series of rooms forming the
second floor of a large monastery, a kind of
labyrinth of which the ground and the first
floors are full of the sick. I find in one of the
upper rooms four or five wounded and feverish
patients, in another ten or fifteen, in a
third about twenty, all neglected (this is
very excusable; there were so many wounded,
everywhere), complaining bitterly of not
having seen a nurse for several hours and
begging insistently that someone bring them
bouillon in place of cold water which they
have for their only drink. At the end of an
interminable corridor, in a little isolated
room, is dying absolutely alone, motionless
on a mattress, a young corporal attacked
with tetanus. Although he seems full of life
as his eyes are wide open, he hears and understands
nothing and remains neglected.</p>

<p>Many of the soldiers beg me to write to
their relatives, some to their captains, who
replace in their eyes their absent families.</p>

<p>In the hospital of Saint Clement, a lady of
Brescia, Countess Bronna, occupies herself,
with saintly self-abnegation, in nursing
those who have had limbs amputated. The
French soldiers speak of her with enthusiasm,
the most repellant details do not stop
her. "Sono madre!" she says to me with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
simplicity: "I am a mother!" These words
well express her devotion as complete as
motherly.</p>

<p>In the hospital San Gaetano, a Franciscan
monk, distinguishes himself by his zeal and
kindness to the sick. A convalescent Piedmontese,
speaking French and Italian, translates
the petitions of the French soldiers to
the Lombardy physicians. They keep him as
interpreter.</p>

<p>In a neighboring hospital chloroform is
used. Some patients are chloroformed with
difficulty, accidents result and sometimes it
is in vain that they try to revive a man who
a few minutes before was speaking.</p>

<p>I am stopped many times on the street by
kind people who beg me to come to their
homes, for a minute, to act as interpreter to
the wounded French officers, lodged in their
houses, surrounded by the best care, but
whose language they do not understand.
The invalids, excited and uneasy, are irritated
at not being understood, to the great
distress of the family whose sympathetic
kindness is received with the bad humour
that fever and suffering often call forth. One
of them, whom an Italian physician desires
to bleed, imagining that they wish to amputate
him, resists with all his strength, overheating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
himself and doing himself much
harm. A few words of explanation in their
mother tongue, in the midst of this lamentable
confusion, alone succeed in calming and
tranquilizing these invalids of Solferino.</p>

<p>With what patience the inhabitants of
Brescia devote themselves to these who have
sacrificed themselves in order to deliver them
from a foreign rule! They feel a real grief
when their charge dies. These adopted families
religiously follow to the cemetery, accompanying
to its last resting place, the
coffin of the French officer, their guest of a
few days, for whom they weep as for a
friend, a relative or a son, but whose name,
perhaps, they do not know.</p>

<p>During the night the soldiers, who have
died in the hospitals, are interred. Their
names and numbers are noted down, which
was rarely done in Castiglione. For example,
the parents of Corporal Mazuet, aided
by me in the Chiesa Maggiore and who lived
in Lyons, 3 Rue d'Alger, never received
other information about their son than that
which I sent them.</p>

<p>All the cities of Lombardy considered it
due to their honor to share in the distribution
of the wounded.</p>

<p>In Bergamo and Cremona special commisions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
organized in haste are aided by auxiliary
committees of devoted ladies. In one
of the hospitals of Cremona an Italian
physician having said: "We keep the good
things for our friends of the allied army,
but we give to our enemies only what is
absolutely necessary, and if they die, so much
the worse for them!" A lady, directing one
of the hospitals of that city, hastened to
disapprove of these barbarous words, saying
that she always took the same care of Austrians,
French and Sardinians, not wishing
to make any difference between friends and
enemies, "for," she said, "Our Lord Jesus
Christ made no distinction between men
when it was a question of doing them good."</p>

<p>In Cremona, as everywhere else, the
French physicians regret their insufficient
number. "I cannot, without profound sorrow,"
said Dr. Sonrier, "think of a small
room of twenty-five beds assigned, in Cremona,
to the most dangerously wounded Austrians.
I see again their faces, emaciated
and wan, with complexion pallid from exhaustion
and blood poisoning, begging with
heartrending gestures, accompanied by pitiful
cries, for one last favor, the amputation
of a limb (which they had hoped to save),<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
to end an intolerable agony of which we are
forced to remain powerless spectators."</p>

<p>Besides the group of courageous and indefatigable
surgeons, whose names I would like
to be able to cite (for, certainly, if to kill men
is a title to glory, to nurse them and cure
them, often at the risk of one's own life,
merits indeed esteem and gratitude), medical
students hasten from Bologna, Pisa and
other Italian cities. A Canadian surgeon,
Dr. Norman Bettun, professor of anatomy in
Toronto, comes to assist these devoted men.
Besides the people of Lombardy, French,
Swiss and Belgian tourists seek to render
themselves useful, but their efforts had to be
limited to the distribution of oranges, ices,
coffee, lemonade and tobacco.</p>

<p>In Plaisance, whose three hospitals are administered
by private individuals, and by
ladies serving as nurses, one of these last, a
young lady, supplicated by her family to
renounce her intention to pass her days in
the hospital, on account of the contagious
fevers there, continued her labors so willingly
and with such kindness that she was
greatly esteemed by all the soldiers. "She
enlivens the hospital," they said.</p>

<p>How valuable, in the cities of Lombardy,
would have been some hundreds of voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
nurses, devoted, experienced and, above all,
previously instructed! They would have rallied
around themselves the meagre band of
assistants and the scattered forces. Not
only was time lacking to those who were
capable of counselling and guiding; but the
necessary knowledge and experience was not
possessed by the greater number of those
who could offer only personal devotion,
which was insufficient and often useless.
What, indeed, in spite of their good will,
could a handful of persons do in such urgent
need? After some weeks the compassionate
enthusiasm began to cool and the people, as
inexperienced as they were injudicious in
their kindness, sometimes brought improper
food to the wounded, so that it was necessary
to deny them entrance to the churches and
hospitals.</p>

<p>Many persons, who would have consented
to pass one or two hours a day with the sick,
gave up their intention, because a special permission
was necessary, which could only be
obtained by petitioning the authorities.
Strangers disposed to help met with all kinds
of unexpected hindrances, of a nature to discourage
them. But voluntary hospital workers,
well chosen and capable, sent by societies
with the sanction of the governments and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
respected because of an agreement between
the belligerents, would have surmounted the
difficulties and done incomparably more good.</p>

<p>During the first eight days after the battle
the wounded, of whom the physicians said, in
low tones, when passing by their beds and
shaking their heads: "There is nothing more
to be done," received no more attention and
died neglected. And is not this very natural
when the scarcity of the nurses is compared
with the enormous number of the wounded?
An inexorable and cruel logic insists that
these unfortunate men should be left to
perish without further care and without having
given to them the precious time that
must be reserved for the soldiers who could
be cured. They were numerous, however,
and not deaf, those unfortunate men on
whom was passed such pitiless judgment!
Soon they perceive their deserted condition
and with a broken and embittered heart gasp
out the last breath while no one notices.</p>

<p>The death of many a one among them is
rendered more sad and bitter by the proximity,
on a cot by his side, of a young soldier,
slightly wounded, whose foolish jokes leave
him neither peace nor tranquillity. On the
other side, one of his companions in misery
has just died; and, he dying, must see and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
hear the funeral ceremony, much too rapidly
performed, which shows him in advance his
own. Finally, about to die, he sees men,
profiting by his weakness, search his knapsack
and steal what they desire.</p>

<p>For that dying man there have been, lying
in the postoffice for eight days, letters from
his family; if he could have had them, they
would have been to him a great consolation;
he has entreated the nurses to bring them
that he may read them before his last hour,
but they replied unkindly, that they had not
time as there was so much else to do.</p>

<p>Better would it have been for you, poor
martyr, if you had perished, struck dead on
the field of butchery, in the midst of
the splendid abomination which men call
"Glory!" Your name, at least, would not
have been forgotten, if you had fallen near
your colonel defending the flag of your regiment.
It would almost have been better for
you had you been buried alive by the peasants
commissioned for that purpose, when
you, unconscious, were carried from the hill
of the Cypresses, from the foot of the tower
of Solferino or from the plains of Medole.
Your agony would not have been long. Now,
it is a succession of miseries that you must
endure, it is no longer the field of honor that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
is presented to you, but cold death with all its
terrors, and the word "disappeared" for a
funeral oration.</p>

<p>What has become of the love of glory
which electrified this brave soldier at the
commencement of the campaign and during
that day at Solferino, when, risking his own
life, he so courageously attempted to take the
lives of his fellow-creatures, whose blood he
ran, with such light feet, to shed? Where is
the irresistible allurement? Where the contagious
enthusiasm, increased by the odor of
powder, by the flourish of trumpets and by
the sound of military music, by the noise of
cannon and the whistling of bullets which
hide the view of danger, suffering and death.</p>

<p>In these many hospitals of Lombardy may
be seen at what price is bought that which
men so proudly call "Glory," and how dearly
this glory costs.</p>

<p>The battle of Solferino is the only one during
our century to be compared by the magnitude
of its losses with the battles of
Moscow, Leipzig and Waterloo.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the twenty-fourth of
June, 1859, it has been calculated that there
were in killed and wounded, in the Austrian
and Franco-Sardinian Armies, three field-marshals,
nine generals, fifteen hundred and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sixty-six officers of all grades, of whom six
hundred and thirty were Austrians and nine
hundred and thirty-six allies, and about
forty thousand soldiers and non-commissioned
officers.</p>

<p>Besides that, from the fifteenth of June to
the thirty-first of August, there were in the
hospitals of Brescia, according to the official
statistics, nineteen thousand six hundred
and sixty-five patients with fever and other
illnesses, of whom more than nineteen thousand
belonged to the Franco-Sardinian
Army.</p>

<p>On their side, the Austrians had at least
twenty thousand sick soldiers in Venice, beside
ten thousand wounded, who, after Solferino,
were sent to Verona, where the overcrowded
hospitals were finally attacked by
gangrene and typhus fever.</p>

<p>Consequently, to the forty thousand killed
and wounded on the twenty-fourth of June,
must be added more than forty thousand sick
with fever or dying from illness caused by
the excessive fatigue experienced on the day
of the battle or during the days which preceded
and succeeded it or from the pernicious
effects of the tropical temperature of the
plains of Lombardy, or, finally, from the
imprudence of these soldiers themselves.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>If one does not consider the military point
of view, the battle of Solferino was then,
from the point of humanity a European
catastrophe.</p>

<p>The transportation of the wounded from
Brescia to Milan, which takes place during
the night because of the torrid heat of the
day, presents a dramatic sight with its trains
loaded with crippled soldiers arriving at the
station filled with crowds of people.</p>

<p>Lighted by the pale flare of the tar torches,
the mass of men seems to hold its breath to
listen to the groans and the stifled complaints
which reach their ears.</p>

<p>The Austrians, in their retreat, having
torn up several places on the railroad between
Milan and Brescia&mdash;this road was restored
for use by the first days of July, for
the transportation of ammunition, of supplies
and of food sent to the allied army&mdash;the
evacuation of the hospitals in Brescia was in
this way facilitated.</p>

<p>At each station, long and narrow
sheds have been constructed to receive the
wounded. These, when taken from the cars,
are placed on mattresses, arranged in a line
one after the other. Under these sheds are
set up tables covered with bread, soup, lemonade,
wine, water, lint, linen and bandages.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
Torches, carried by the young men of the
place where the convoy stops, light the darkness.
The citizens of Lombardy hasten to
present their tribute of gratitude to the conquerors
of Solferino; in respectful silence
they bandage the wounded whom they have
lifted carefully out of the cars to place them
on the beds made ready for their use. The
women of the country offer refreshing
drinks, and food of all kinds, which they
distribute on the cars to those who must go
on to Milan.</p>

<p>In this city, where about a thousand
wounded have arrived every night for several
nights in succession, the martyrs of Solferino
are received with great kindness. No
longer are rose leaves scattered from the
flag-ornamented balconies of the luxurious
palaces of the Milanese aristocracy, on shining
epaulets and on striped gold and enameled
orders, by beautiful and graceful ladies
whom exaltation and enthusiasm rendered
still more beautiful. To-day, in their gratitude,
they shed tears of compassion which
are interpreted by devotion and sacrifice.</p>

<p>Every family possessing a carriage, goes
to the station to transport the wounded. The
number of equipages sent by the people of
Milan probably exceeds five hundred. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
finest carriages as well as the most modest
carts are sent every evening to Porto Tosca,
where stands the railroad station for Venice.
The Italian ladies consider it an honor to
themselves to place in their rich carriages,
which they have provided with mattresses,
sheets and pillows, the guests assigned to
them and who are accompanied by the
greatest noblemen of Lombardy, aided in
this work by their not less considerate
servants.</p>

<p>The people applaud the passage of these
men, famed because of their suffering. They
respectfully uncover their heads. They follow
the slow march of the convoy with
torches illuminating the sad faces of the
wounded, who try to smile. They accompany
them to the door of the hospitable palace,
where awaits them the most devoted care.</p>

<p>Every family wishes to receive the French
wounded and, by all sorts of kindness, try to
lessen the sadness caused by distance from
home, from parents and from friends.</p>

<p>But after a few days the greater number
of the inhabitants of Milan are obliged to remove
to the hospitals the wounded whom
they have received in their houses. The administration
desires to avoid too great scattering
of the nursing and any increase of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fatigue for the physicians. Before Solferino,
the hospitals of this city contained about nine
thousand wounded from preceding battles.</p>

<p>Great Milanese ladies watch beside the bed
of the simple soldier, of whom they become
the guardian angels. Countess Verri,
ne Borromo, Madame Uboldi de Capei,
Madame Boselli, Madame Sala-Taverna,
Countess Taverna and many others, forgetting
their luxurious habits, pass whole
months by these beds of suffering. Some of
these ladies are mothers, whose mourning
garments testify to a recent and sorrowful
loss. One of them said: "The war robbed
me of my oldest son; he died eight months
ago, from a shot received while fighting with
the French Army at Sebastopol. When I
knew that the French wounded were coming
to Milan and that I could nurse them, I felt
that God was sending me His first consolation."</p>

<p>Countess Verri-Borromo, president of the
Central Aid Committee, has charge of the
great depot for linens and lint. In spite of
her advanced age she devotes many hours a
day to reading to the sick.</p>

<p>All the palaces contain wounded. That of
the Borromo family has received three hundred.
The Superior of the Ursulines, Sister<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
Marina Videmari, has converted her convent
into a hospital and serves in it with her companions.
This convent-hospital is a model
of order and cleanliness.</p>

<p>The Marchioness Pallavicini-Trivulzio,
who presides over the great Turin Committee
with admirable devotion and self-forgetfulness,
collects the donations from different
cities and countries; thanks to her activity
the depot in Milan, situated contrada San
Paolo, remains always well provided.</p>

<p>Some weeks later, in the streets of Milan,
there were seen passing a few companies of
convalescent French soldiers sadly returning
to France. Some have their arms in slings,
others are supported by crutches or bear
marks of wounds. Their uniforms are well
worn and torn, but they wear fine linen,
which the rich men of Lombardy have generously
given them in exchange for their
blood-stained shirts: "Your blood flowed to
defend our country," they said, "and we
wish to keep these memories of it." These
men, not long ago so strong, so robust, now
deprived of an arm or a leg or with head
bandaged, bear their misfortune with resignation.
But, thus incapable of continuing in
the army and earning bread for their
families, they already with bitterness, behold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
themselves, after their return to their native
land, objects of commiseration and pity, a
care to others and to themselves.</p>

<p>In one of the hospitals of Milan, a sergeant
of the Zouave Guard, with an energetic
and proud face, who has had one leg amputated
and had borne that operation without a
complaint, was seized, some time after, with
extreme sadness, although his health was improving
and his recovery rapidly taking
place. This sadness, increasing daily, was
incomprehensible. A Sister of Charity, perceiving
tears in his eyes, questioned so insistently
that he at last confessed that he
was the sole support of his aged and infirm
mother to whom he used to send each month
five francs of his pay. He added that, being
unable to help her, this poor woman must be
in great need of money. The Sister of
Charity, touched with compassion, gave him
five francs, the value of which was immediately
sent to France. When the directress
of the hospital wished to make him another
gift, he would not accept it, and said to her
thankfully: "Keep this money for others
who need it more than I; as for my mother,
I hope next month to send her her usual
allowance, for I count on soon being able to
work."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>A lady of Milan, bearing an illustrious
name, placed at the disposition of the
wounded one of her palaces, with one hundred
and fifty beds. Among the soldiers,
lodged in this magnificent mansion, was a
grenadier of the Seventieth Regiment of the
French Infantry, who, having undergone an
operation, was in danger of death. The
lady, trying to console him, spoke to him of
his family. He told her that he was the only
son of poor peasants in the Department of
Gers, and that he was very sad at leaving
his parents in misery, for he alone
provided for their maintenance. He added
that his greatest consolation would be to
kiss his mother before he died. Saying
nothing to him of her project, the noble
lady suddenly decides to leave Milan, takes
the train, reaches the Departments of Gers,
near the family, whose address she has procured,
takes possession of the mother of the
wounded man. After having left a large sum
of money for the infirm old father, she brings
the humble villager with her to Milan; and
six days after the confession of the grenadier,
the son kisses his mother, weeping and
blessing his benefactress.</p>

<p>But why recall so many pitiful and melancholy
scenes and thus arouse such painful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
emotions? Why relate, with complaisance,
these lamentable details and dwell upon these
distressing pictures?</p>

<p>To this very natural question we reply
with another question.</p>

<p>Would it not be possible to establish in
every country of Europe, Aid Societies,
whose aim would be to provide, during war,
volunteer nurses for the wounded, without
distinction of nationality?</p>

<p>As they wish us to give up the desires and
hopes of the Societies of the Friends of
Peace, the beautiful dreams of the Abbot of
Saint Pierre and of Count Sellon; as men
continue to kill each other without personal
enmity, and as the height of glory in war
is to exterminate the greatest number
possible; as they still dare to say, as did
Count Joseph de Maistre, that "war is divine";
as they invent every day with a perseverence
worthy of a better aim, instruments
of destruction more and more terrible, and
as the inventors of these death-dealing engines
are encouraged by all the European
governments&mdash;who arm themselves in emulation
one of another&mdash;why not profit from a
moment of comparative calm and tranquillity
in order to settle the question which we have
just raised, and which is of such great importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
from the double point of view of
humanity and Christianity.</p>

<p>Once presented to the consideration of
every man, this theme will probably call
forth opinions and writings from more competent
persons; but, first, must not this idea,
presented to the different branches of the
great European family, hold the attention
and conquer the sympathies of all those who
possess an elevated soul and a heart capable
of being moved by the suffering of their
fellow-men?</p>

<p>Such is the purpose for which this book
has been written.</p>

<p>Societies of this kind, once created, with a
permanent existence, would be found all
ready at the time of war. They should obtain
the favor of the authorities of countries
where they are created, and beg, in case of
war, from the sovereigns of the belligerent
powers the permission and the facilities
necessary to carry out their purpose. These
societies should include in their own and
each country, as members of the central committee,
the most honorable and esteemed
men.</p>

<p>The moment of the commencement of war,
the committee would call on those persons
who desire to dedicate themselves, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
time being, to this work, which will consist
in helping and nursing, under the guidance
of experienced physicians, the wounded, first
on the battle-field, then in the field and regular
hospitals.</p>

<p>Spontaneous devotion is not as rare as one
might think. Many persons, sure of being
able to do some good, helped and facilitated
by a Superior Committee, would certainly
go, and others, at their own expense, would
undertake a task so essentially beneficent.
During our selfish century what an attraction
for the generous-hearted and for chivalrous
characters to brave the same danger
as the soldier with an entirely voluntary mission
of peace and consolation.</p>

<p>History proves that it is in no way chimerical
to hope for such self-devotion. Two
recent facts especially have just confirmed
this. They occurred during the war in the
East and closely relate to our subject.</p>

<p>While Sisters of Charity were nursing the
wounded and sick of the French army in
the Crimea, into the Russian and English
armies, there came, from the north and west,
two groups of self-devoted women nurses.</p>

<p>The Grand Duchess Helen Pavlovna, of
Russia, born, Princess Charlotte, of Wurttemberg,
widow of the Grand Duke Michael,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
having enlisted nearly three hundred ladies
of St. Petersburg and Moscow, to serve as
nurses in the Russian hospitals of the Crimea;
she provided them with everything
necessary, and these saintly women were
blessed by thousands of soldiers.</p>

<p>In England, Miss Florence Nightingale,
having received a pressing appeal from Lord
Sidney Herbert, Secretary of War of the
British Empire, inviting her to go to the aid
of the English soldiers in the Orient, this
lady did not hesitate to expose herself personally
by great self-devotion. In November,
1854, she went to Constantinople and Scutari
with thirty-seven English ladies, who,
immediately on arrival gave their attention
to nursing the great number of men,
wounded in the battle of Inkerman. In 1855
Miss Stanley, having come to take part in her
labor with fifty new companions, made it
possible for Miss Nightingale to go to Balaklava
to inspect the hospitals there. The picture
of Miss Florence Nightingale, during
the night, going through the vast wards of
the military hospitals with a small lamp in
her hand, noting the condition of each sick
man, will never be obliterated from the
hearts of the men, who were the objects or
the witnesses of her admirable beneficence,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and the memory of it will be engraven in
history.</p>

<p>Of the multitude of similar good works,
ancient or modern, the greater number of
which have remained unknown and without
fame, how many have been in vain, because
they were isolated and were not supported
by a united action, which would have wisely
joined them together for a common aim.</p>

<p>If voluntary hospital workers could have
been found in Castiglione on the twenty-fourth,
the twenty-fifth, and the twenty-sixth
of June, and also in Brescia, Mantua,
and Verona, how much good they might have
done.</p>

<p>How many human beings they might have
saved from death during that fatal Friday
night, when moans and heartrending supplications
escaped from the breasts of thousands
of the wounded, who were enduring the
most acute pains and tormented by the inexpressible
suffering of thirst.</p>

<p>If Prince von Isenburg had been rescued
sooner, by compassionate hands, from the
blood-soaked field on which he was lying unconscious,
he would not have been obliged to
suffer for several years from wounds aggravated
by long neglect; if the sight of his
riderless horse had not brought about his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
discovery among the corpses, he would have
perished for lack of help with so many other
wounded, who also were creatures of God,
and whose death would be equally cruel for
their families.</p>

<p>Those good old women, those beautiful
young girls of Castiglione could not save the
lives of many of those whom they nursed!
Besides them were needed experienced men,
skillful, decided, previously trained to act
with order and harmony, the only means of
preventing the accidents, which complicate
the wounds and make them mortal.</p>

<p>If there could have been a sufficient number
of assistants to remove the wounded
quickly from the plains of Medole, from the
ravines of San Martin, on the slopes of
Mount Fontana, or on the hills of Solferino,
there would not have been left during long
hours of terrible fear that poor bersaglier,
that Uhlan, or that Zouave, who tried to raise
himself, in spite of cruel suffering, to gesticulate
in vain for someone to send a litter for
him. Finally, the risk of burying the living
with the dead would have been avoided.</p>

<p>Better means of transportation would
have made it possible to avoid in the case of
the light infantryman of the Guard the terrible
amputation which he had to undergo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
in Brescia, because of the lack of proper
care during the journey from the battle-field
to Castiglione.</p>

<p>The sight of those young cripples, deprived
of an arm, or a leg, returning sadly to their
homes, does it not call forth remorse that
there was not more effort made before to
avert the evil consequences of the wounds,
which, often could have been cured by timely
aid?</p>

<p>Would those dead, deserted in the hospitals
of Castiglione, or in those of Brescia, many
of whom could not make themselves understood,
on account of the difference of language,
have gasped out their last breath with
curses and blasphemies, if they had had near
them some compassionate soul to listen to
them and console them?</p>

<p>In spite of the official aid, in spite of the
zeal of the cities of Lombardy, much remained
to be done, although in no other war
has been seen so great a display of charity;
it was nevertheless unequal to the extent of
the help that was needed.</p>

<p>It is not the paid employee, whom disgust
drives away, whom fatigue makes unfeeling,
unsympathetic and lazy who can fulfil
such a noble task. Immediate help is
needed, for that which can to-day save the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
wounded will not save him to-morrow; the
loss of time causes gangrene, which leads to
death. One must have volunteer nurses, previously
trained, accustomed to the work,
officially recognized by the commanding
officers of the armies, so that they may be
facilitated in their mission.</p>

<p>These nurses should not only find their
place on the battle-field, but also in the hospitals,
where the long weeks pass away painfully
for the wounded, without family and
without friends. During this short Italian
war, there were soldiers who were attacked
with home-sickness to such a degree that,
without other illness and without wounds,
they died. On the other hand, the Italians,
and this is comprehensible, showed scarcely
any interest in the wounded of the allied
army, and still less for the suffering Austrians.
It is true, courageous women were
found in Italy, whose patience and perseverance
never wearied; but, unfortunately,
in the end they could be easily counted; the
contagious fevers drove many persons away,
and the nurses and servants did not respond
for any length of time, to that which might
have been expected of them. The personnel
of the military hospitals is always insufficient;
and, if it were doubled or tripled, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
would still be insufficient. We must call on
the public, it is not possible, it never will be
possible to avoid that. Only by this co-operation
can one hope to lessen the sufferings
of war.</p>

<p>An appeal must be made, a petition presented
to the men of all countries, of all
classes, to the influential of this world, as
well as to the most modest artisan, since all
can, in one way or another, each in his own
sphere, and according to his strength, co-operate
in some measure in this good work.</p>

<p>This appeal is addressed to women as well
as to men, to the queen, to the princess seated
on the steps of the throne, as well as to the
humble orphaned and charitable maid-servant
or the poor widow alone in the world,
who desires to consecrate her last strength to
the good of others.</p>

<p>It is addressed to the general, to the marshal,
the Minister of War, as well as to the
writer and the man of letters, who, by his
publications, can plead with ability for the
cause, thereby interesting all mankind, each
nation, each country, each family even, since
no one can say for certain that he is exempt
from the dangers of war.</p>

<p>If an Austrian general and a French general,
after having fought one against another<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
at Solferino, could, soon afterwards, finding
themselves seated side by side at the hospitable
table of the King of Prussia, converse
amicably one with the other, what would
have prevented them from considering and
discussing a question so worthy of their interest
and attention?</p>

<p>During the grand man&oelig;uvers at Cologne,
in 1861, King William of Prussia invited to
dinner, in Benrath Castle, near Dusseldorf,
the officers of the different nations, who were
sent there by their governments. Before going
to the table the King took by the hand
General Forey and General Baumgarten:
"Now that you are friends," he said to them,
smiling, "sit there, beside one another, and
chat." Forey was the victor of Montebello,
and Baumgarten was his adversary.</p>

<p>On extraordinary occasions, such as those
which assembled at Cologne, at Chalons, or
elsewhere, eminent men of the military art
of different nations, is it not to be desired
that they will profit by this kind of congress
to formulate some international, sacred, and
accepted principle which, once agreed upon
and ratified, would serve as the foundation
for societies for aid for the wounded in the
different countries of Europe? It is still
more important to agree upon and adopt in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
advance these measures, because when hostilities
have commenced, the belligerents are
ill-disposed one towards the other, and will
not consider these questions, except from
the exclusive point of view of their own
interests.</p>

<p>Are not small congresses called together of
scientists, jurists, medical men, agriculturists,
statisticians, and economists, who meet
expressly in order to consider questions of
much less importance? Are there not international
societies which are occupied with
questions of charity and public utility? Cannot
men, in like manner, meet to solve a
problem as important as that of caring for
the victims of war?</p>

<p>Humanity and civilization surely demand
the accomplishment of such a work. It is
a duty, to the fulfilment of which every good
man, and every person possessing any influence
owes his assistance.</p>

<p>What prince, what ruler, would refuse his
support to these societies, and would not be
glad to give the soldiers of his army the full
assurance that they will be immediately and
properly nursed in case they should be
wounded?</p>

<p>With permanent societies, such as I propose,
the chance of waste and the injudicious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
distribution of money and supplies would
often be avoided. During the war in the
East an enormous quantity of lint, prepared
by Russian ladies, was sent from St. Petersburg
to the Crimea; but the packages, instead
of reaching the hospitals to which they
were sent, arrived at paper mills which used
it all for their own industry.</p>

<p>By perfecting the means of transportation,
by preventing the accidents during the
journey from the battle-field to the hospital,
many amputations will be avoided, and the
burden of the governments, which pension
the injured will be proportionately lessened.</p>

<p>These societies, by their permanent existence,
could also render great service at
the time of epidemics, floods, great fires, and
other unexpected catastrophes; the humane
motive which would have created them
would instigate them to act on all occasions
in which their labors could be exercised.</p>

<p>This work will necessitate the devotion of
a certain number of persons, but it will never
lack money in time of war. Each one will
bring his offering or his compassion in response
to the appeals which will be made by
the committee. A nation will not remain
indifferent when its children are fighting for
its defense. The difficulty is not there; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
the problem rests entirely in the serious
preparation, in all countries, of a work of
this kind, that is, in the creation of these
societies.</p>

<p>In order to establish these committees at
the head of the societies, all that is necessary
is a little good-will on the part of some honorable
and persevering persons. The committees,
animated by an international spirit
of charity, would create corps of nurses in
a latent state, a sort of staff. The committees
of the different nations, although independent
of one another, will know how to
understand and correspond with each other,
to convene in congress and, in event of war,
to act for the good of all.</p>

<p>If the terrible instruments of destruction
now possessed by the nations seem to shorten
wars, will not, on the other hand, the battles
be more deadly? And in this century, when
the unexpected plays such an important role,
may not war bring about the most sudden
and unforseen results?</p>

<p>Are there not, in these considerations
alone, more than sufficient reasons for us not
to allow ourselves to be taken unawares?</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
